# Haskell undefined value error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell: using the `undefined` value.  The `undefined` value represents a computation that hasn't been defined, leading to runtime errors when it's used in expressions.

The `bug.hs` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.hs` file shows how to correct this using pattern matching or default values.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive handling of potential undefined values in Haskell to avoid unexpected runtime behavior.
